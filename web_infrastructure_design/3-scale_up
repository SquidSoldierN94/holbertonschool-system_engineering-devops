### **3-scale_up**

#### **Task Description**
Design a scaled-up web infrastructure for `www.foobar.com` with the following elements:

1. A load balancer configured as a cluster.
2. Servers dedicated to specific roles:
   - Web server (Nginx).
   - Application server.
   - Database server (MySQL).

### **Infrastructure Description**

1. **Load Balancer:**
   - **Purpose:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and scalability.
   - **Configuration:** Set up in a clustered environment for redundancy. If one load balancer fails, the other can handle the traffic.
   - **Reason for Adding:**
     - Avoid single points of failure (SPOF).
     - Balance traffic to ensure optimal resource usage and prevent overloading.

2. **Dedicated Servers:**
   - **Web Server (Nginx):**
     - **Purpose:** Handles static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and forwards requests to the application server.
     - **Reason for Adding:** Separation of concerns improves performance and maintainability.
   - **Application Server:**
     - **Purpose:** Executes the business logic and serves dynamic content based on the application's code base.
     - **Reason for Adding:** Offloads processing from the web server and focuses on dynamic request handling.
   - **Database Server (MySQL):**
     - **Purpose:** Stores application data and ensures data integrity.
     - **Reason for Adding:** Centralizes data storage and management.

### **Key Considerations**

1. **Why Add a Clustered Load Balancer?**
   - Ensures high availability by preventing a SPOF at the load balancer level.
   - Improves scalability by distributing traffic effectively across multiple servers.

2. **Why Split Components?**
   - **Improved Performance:** Each server focuses on specific tasks, reducing the load on individual components.
   - **Scalability:** Makes it easier to scale individual layers of the infrastructure.
   - **Maintainability:** Easier to troubleshoot and optimize specific components without affecting others.

### **Diagram Notes**
Your diagram should include:
1. **Load Balancers (Clustered):** Connected to the web server layer.
2. **Web Server:** Dedicated to serving static files and forwarding requests to the application server.
3. **Application Server:** Dedicated to running the application logic.
4. **Database Server:** Dedicated to handling and storing application data.

---

### **Steps to Complete**
1. **Create the Diagram:**
   - Show the clustered load balancers and split components with arrows indicating traffic flow.
2. **Upload the Diagram:**
   - Save your diagram as an image and upload it to an image hosting service (e.g., Imgur).
   - Include the URL in the `Whiteboard Diagram` section above.
3. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Ensure the file is named `3-scale_up` and commit it to your repository.
